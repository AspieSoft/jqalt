# JQAlt (JQuery Alternative) (Alpha)

This script is a attempt to replace the heavy jquery with a lightweight alternative.
Rather than completely copying what jquery does, this module brings some different capabilities.

I have used JQuery a lot, and its great, but it is old. Modern javascript now has builtin functions, and [The IE browser is finally being retired](https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443997/microsoft-internet-explorer-end-of-support-date).
Soon, the bulk of old browser support may not be as necessary, and taking out JQuery as a dependency can help site performance.

JQuery still has a nice syntax though, and the vanilla js `document.querySelectorAll` is long and wordy compared to `$()` being much shorter.
